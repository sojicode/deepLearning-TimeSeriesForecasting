## DeepLearning-Time Series Forecasting

### Goal
Apply deep learning to do **`time series forecasting`.** To create deep learning models to predict future traffic volume at a location in Minnesota, between Minneapolis and St Paul.

### Explore to build an Optimal Model(LSTM model)
* Batch size
* Number of recurrent units
* Stacking recurrent layers
* Statefulness
* Recurrent dropout
* Bidirectional RNNs
* Combining CNNs with recurrent networks
> * 1D convnet + RNN
> * 1D convnet + GRU
* Performance optimization and CuDNN kernels
